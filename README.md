This repository contains materials and code examples from the DeepLearning.AI short course "Quantization in Depth", instructed by Marc Sun and Younes Belkada from Hugging Face.

## üìö Course Overview

"Quantization in Depth" teaches advanced techniques to compress neural network models, reducing their size to a fraction of the original while maintaining performance. By implementing customized quantization methods from scratch, you'll gain deep insights into the tradeoffs between model size and accuracy, enabling faster inference and broader deployment of AI models.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

- Implement and compare different variants of linear quantization (symmetric vs. asymmetric mode)
- Apply varying granularity levels: per-tensor, per-channel, and per-group quantization
- Build a general-purpose quantizer in PyTorch that can compress any open source model's dense layers by up to 4x
- Implement weights packing techniques to compress weights from 32 bits to as low as 2 bits
